## Growth Mindset

A growth mindset means recognizing that all engineering team members have **the potential to learn and improve**. By setting learning objectives for each team member, the manager and domain leadership are providing them with the resources and opportunities they need to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success in their roles. 
 
The process is designed to ensure that everyone has the resources they need for success at the right time and in the correct sequence.

By fostering a culture of continuous learning, the company can ensure that its engineering team is always at the cutting edge of the industry, allowing it to remain competitive and continue delivering value to its customers.

### Why learning important for an engineer?

 * **Career advancement:** Continuing education and professional development can help software engineers move up in their organizations, take on more responsibility, or transition into new roles.
 * **Improving skills and knowledge:** Professional development opportunities allow engineers to deepen their understanding of specific technologies or programming languages, and to acquire new skills that can make them more valuable to their organizations.

### Why learning important for the organization?

 * **Staying competitive:** Companies that have a workforce of engineers who are up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends are better positioned to compete in today's marketplace.
 * **Improving employee productivity:** Engineers who stay current with new technologies and industry trends are better equipped to solve problems, complete projects, and implement new features.
 * **Enhancing employee retention:** Engineers who feel that their companies are investing in their professional growth are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and stay with the company for the long-term.
 * **Attracting top talent:** Companies that offer professional development opportunities are more attractive to talented engineers who are looking for opportunities to grow and advance their careers.

## Managing Learning Process

[The Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP5GXPEY=/?share_link_id=11559878279) with the processes and other artifacts.

Here are parts of the learning roadmap process that should sync with the Product roadmap process.

From a time perspective, here are relative timelines for the Product roadmap-building process and both **3-month and 6-months cadence processes**.

#### 3-month process

### Tracking Performance

Every manager should define success in respect of his organization needs and context. However, as a
learning organization we must have at least one measure to monitor relative performance. To track it
we're using [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) and [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvzYQbkMUa5hVeQ2ctsgtaPLBBU4XG7VxwFX5kbPIKs/edit#gid=1988755482)

**Learning Performance OKR:**

| **Objective**  |  **Key Results**  |
