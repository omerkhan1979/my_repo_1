## Guilds
Guilds consist of individuals who share a vested interest in furthering a shared capability at Takeoff.

Guilds are led by a duo of two Engineering disciplines:
- Director of Engineering
- Architect

Guilds are not explicitly staffed but are instead virtually staffed by members of existing scrum/kanban teams. Percentage of time dedicated to guild activities may vary depending on a member's guild as well as their role within the guild.
