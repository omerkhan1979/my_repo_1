Two types of reporting are available:

- [Testrail Reporting](/docs/reporting/01-testrail-reporting.md) - Where Release Qualification and other testing results are published.
- [Allure Reports](/docs/reporting/02-allure-reports.md) - These use the [Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/) framework to help visualize test results.
