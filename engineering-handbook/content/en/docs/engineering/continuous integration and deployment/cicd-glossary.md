## CI/CD Glossary

***"Glossary"*** a list of acronyms and terms in a special subject, field, or area of usage, with accompanying definitions.

| Term | Meaning|
|---|---|
| **application** | is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application. An application can be self-contained or a group of programs. |
| **build** | is a process that involves multiple steps as fetch SC (source code) components from the repo, compile code, and link libraries and other modules.  The result is a simple executable file, or a more complex assembly such as a deployable container or VM. |
| **build artifacts** | are files produced by a build. Typically, these include distribution packages, WAR files, reports, log files, and so on. |
| **CI/CD** | CI/CD is the acronym in software development for the combination of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). It can also be expanded to include continuous deployment, but to avoid confusion, we’ll be using CD to refer to continuous delivery. |
| **CI** | is a practice that involves developers making small changes and checks to their code. Due to the scale of requirements and the number of steps involved, this process is automated to ensure that teams can build, test, and package their applications in a reliable and repeatable way.  CI helps streamline code changes, thereby increasing time for developers to make changes and contribute to improved software. |
| **CD** | is the process of automating delivery of an application to any infrastructure environment. (If that happens to be the production environment, it’s termed “continuous deployment”.) Typically, continuous delivery processes push code to development, staging, or testing environments. |
| **Continuous deployment** | is the next step of continuous delivery (CD). Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments. |
| **Continuous testing** | an approach that involves a process of testing early, testing often, test everywhere, and automate to obtain feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate as rapidly as possible. |
| **coverage** | the degree to which specified coverage items (tests coverage) have been determined or have been exercised by a test suite expressed as a percentage. |
| **container** |is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. |
| **Deploy, deployment** | is the mechanism through which applications, modules, updates, and patches are delivered from developers to users. The methods used by developers to build, test and deploy new code will impact how fast a product can respond to changes in customer preferences or requirements and the quality of each change. |
| **Github Actions** | Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow. |
| **Integration tests** | a test level that focuses on interactions between components or systems. The focus of the integration testing level is to expose defects at the time of interaction between integrated components or units. |
| **Lint, linter**  |  is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. ***Linting*** is a process by a linter program that analyzes source code in a particular programming language and flag potential problems like syntax errors, deviations from a prescribed coding style or using constructs known to be unsafe.  |
| **PAT** | GitHub Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. |
| **pipeline** | pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during execution. Pipeline is divided into stages and these stages are connected with one another to form a pipe like structure. |
| **plan** | is the process by which a program is conceived and brought to fruition. |
| **release** | is the distribution of the final version or the newest version of a software application. A software release may be public or private and generally signifies the unveiling of a new or upgraded version of the application. |
| **SC** | source code is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text. |
| **Unit/Component tests** | a test level that focuses on individual hardware or software components. |
| **Webhook** |  is a lightweight API that powers one-way data sharing triggered by events. |
