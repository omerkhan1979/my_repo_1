## Courses and Certification Reimbursement

Some courses are outside of Coursera corporate subscription. Feel free to use your **$200 annual budget for Learning**, which is available for each member of the engineering organization.
For [**Agile certification**](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications), the process looks the same â€“ Takeoff covers the first attempt to take the certification exam.
Any other certifications reimbursement should be approved with line manager.


There's a separate process for **GCP Certification**. Please, reach your manager to get a voucher code for the first attempt.

The Reimbursement mechanics are the following:
 1. Confirm with your manager that you want to take a particular course
 1. Buy a course using personal funds.
 1. To reimburse expenses:
    * **For Ukraine:** Send an email to Iryna Hlymba with the receipt to receive reimbursement as part of the next salary payment (please, reach *Irina Hlymba* for any additional details)
    * **For the US**: Track expenses in corporate expenses in **Expensify** (please, reach *Denise Gallagher* for any additional details)
    * **For India**: contact your manager to get more details about the process
