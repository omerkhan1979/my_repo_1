Multilingual support extends Takeoff’s customers' experience to people who don’t speak English, or who are more comfortable conversing in another language. Translating the content of Takeoff’s apps is an important thing if we are working with international clients.

Existing TakeOff apps that need to be considered for multi-language support:

* Decanting UI
* Micro Frontend
* TakeOff Mobile App
* Tom UI

# Guidelines

![](/images/en/docs/Learning/ui-ux/guidelines.png)

This document lists the guidelines on naming keys.
## Group translation keys into namespaces
Use namespace to avoid duplication of keys. We need to ensure consistency in naming the namespace hence we propose using the name of the feature as the namespace.

e.g. TruckLoad, Fulfilment, Receiving etc.

## Use Pascal casing to name the keys
Use the pascal case to name to keys. Pascal casing makes the key readable. Always give a meaningful name to keys. It is advised to assign a name which describes the text.

Examples:
```
TruckLoad.ShortLoadTitle
TruckLoad.ShortLoadMissingTotesConfirmMessage
TruckLoad.ShortLoadMissingTotesCount
Fullfillment.InvalidStagingLocation
Fullfillment.InvalidTote
Fullfillment.StagingLocationNotFound
```

## Use global namespace to group common translations
In the application we may have many places where we have standard texts to buttons like Next, Cancel, Confirm etc.Instead of creating duplicate keys for these texts we can easily group them under a general or global namespace.

Examples:
```
Global.Ok
Global.Cancel
Global.Next
```

## Avoid concatenating translations
Most of the time to optimise for duplication developers tend to divide the sentence into multiple parts and concatenate the translations. For example, the sentences Confirm and Proceed can be converted into
```
t('Global.Confirm','Confirm') + t('Global.And','And') + t('Global.Proceed','Proceed')
```
This should be avoided as many languages can produce different meanings to sentences vs combining individual words.

## Providing context while doing translations
By providing a context you can differentiate translations. Eg. useful when providing gender-specific translations.

```
t('Friend'); // -> "A friend"
t('Friend', { context: 'male' }); // -> "A boyfriend"
t('Friend', { context: 'female' }); // -> "A girlfriend"
```
This gets translated into keys as follows:
```
{
  "Friend": "A friend",
  "Friend_male": "A boyfriend",
  "Friend_female": "A girlfriend"
}
```
For more details refer to https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/context

## Handling plural while doing translations
We recommend not using plural translation approach provided by i18n plugin & stick to simple approach of writing different translations for singular & plural texts.

Disadvantage of using i18n plural translation approach:
* It would end up generating multiple keys with same value because you can have only one default value either you put it in plural or singular form.
* As we are having two keys with same value developers have to manually change the value for the plural key after generation of translation JSON which is a overhead.

e.g. for the below code 
```
<Text>{{numberOfTotes}} totes</Text>
```
i18n recommendation:
```
<Text>t('OrderDetails.Totes','{{count}} tote', {count: numberOfTotes})</Text>
```

Our recommendation:
```
<Text>numberOfTotes === 1 ? t('OrderDetails.Tote','{{totes}} tote', {totes: numberOfTotes}) : 
t('OrderDetails.Totes','{{totes}} totes', {totes: numberOfTotes})
</Text>
```
## Handling complex elements
[Trans](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component) gives ability to translate complex React elements, in most cases you don't even need it.
But if you have <Text> element embedded into a another <Text> element you have to use Tran element.

e.g. For the following sentence some of part of the text is in bold
```
<Text>Please <Text style={{ fontWeight: '700' }}>walk back into the MFC</Text> and try again.</Text>
```
One approach to solve this use case is split the sentence into two part & translate them seperatoly however doing so would result in loosing the context & we would end up with wrong translations.
Using Trans element to handle such a cases would make it simple as shown below:

```
<Trans i18nKey="InStorePicking.PleaseWalkBackToMFC"
    defaults="Please <TextBold>walk back into the MFC</TextBold> and try again."
    components={{ TextBold: <Text style={{ fontWeight: '700' }} /> }}
/> 
```
The embedded is named as TextBold & developer can choose any name for this element.

## Values with different case
Many places we have same values with different case which would lead to confusion on how to name the keys.
e.g. Totes is named as Totes at one place & totes at different place.

If you encounter such scenario developer should have different keys for each value like shown in below example.

```
t('Global.Totes','Totes')
t('ProductDetails.totes','totes')
```

# Linters
The implemented translations needs to be checked against the guidelines. Linters play a key role in doing
1. Scan target code and extract translation keys/values
2. Check if the translation keys are as per guidelines
3. Check for missing literals in target code

## Scanner
 ### Scan target code and extract translation keys/values.
 ### Store the key-value pairs in a json file. 
It can be configured as per the usecase.
#### Key configurations
  - input         : Include or exclude source files
  - func          : List of functions to look for 
translation keys
  - ns            : namespace for the translation keys
  - plural        : Support for plural keys by the plugin
  - interpolation : Prefix and suffix for interpolation

  Example:
  <br>Input:<br> ```<Button
                                    color="primary"
                                    title={t('Global.Reload', 'Reload')}
                                    size="field"
                                    testID="reloadButton"
                                />```
  <br><br>Output:<br> "Global.Reload": "Reload"

## Linter
  ### Check the keys against validation rules 
#### Key configurations
  - Properties to include or exclude while parsing:
  <br>jsx-components, attributes, words, object properties, class properties
  - Files/paths to include or exclude while parsing
<br><br>
  #### Validation rules
  - Key length validation: Max key length allowed is 128 chars.
  - Namespace validation: Key must be having a namespace
  ```eg: 
  t("Reload", "Reload")          -> wrong  
  t("GlobalReload", "Reload" )   -> wrong
  t("Global.Reload", "Reload")   -> correct
  ```
  - Pascal case validation: Key must be in pascal case.
  ```
  t("Global.reload", "Reload")   -> wrong
  t("global.Reload", "Reload")   -> wrong
  t("Global.Reload", "Reload")   -> correct
  ```

  - Default value validation: Evry key must be having a default value.
  ```
  t("Global.Reload")             -> wrong
  t("Global.Reload", "Reload")   -> correct
  ```

  ### Find missing literals from translation
It shows list of literal which are not in i18n format along with filename, line number and position.

:warning: It may give false positive results in case of some scenarios, like internal states or actions hence should be used as reference and not as an acceptance criterion.
