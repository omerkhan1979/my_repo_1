## What OSR actually is
---

An ftp non-prod server that stands for the OSRs real FTP service. 
Events are mostly “passed through”, but there are some validations performed.  
The outputs roughly imitate the outputs given by the physical OSR but the variety and realism of responses provided is limited.

  {{% alert title="Note" color="green" %}}
  According to acronym and general definition: **OSR - Order Storage & Retrieval** (big robot machine - 6600 totes) .{{% /alert %}}
    
As you know, Takeoff provides automation services for retail shops. 
Since the shop and retail part of the formula has already been established by the time takeoff arrives, the automation part is yet to be fulfilled. 
Whether you are currently onboarding or have already finished this period of employment, you may have heard about OSR. 
It is not an Old School Revival or Old School Renaissance but something rather different. 
The origins of the acronym are unbeknownst to the author of this text, but what matters is it’s essence - a roboticized, 
IRL excel sheet, cells of which are occupied by the stock of a particular grocery item. 
This machine is not only capable of storing items, but has methods of interacting with the stock by adding or returning 
those items in different permutations. 
Even though there may be different locations of items within one MFC, say OSR, a shelf, a store shelf, the stock in OSR represents the majority 
of the things one can order at the MFC. 
A software engineer working with a particular software has a definite headstart by being able to interact with the real-life application of his product. 
Having a portable OSR nearby is a beneficial but a cumbersome opportunity due to the sheer size of the thing. 
That is where the OSR replicator comes into the spotlight. It is a virtual representation of the machine, capable of executing similar tasks, such as: 
Sync product information, Picking products, etc.

### Flow and flows

In order to control such a machine in a digital way, we may need some sort of an API. 
Gladly, KNAPP has developed an extensive system of interactions with the OSR and the main unit of such interaction is called an event. 
As the name implies, it is a self-contained signal directed to the OSR which contains an event type along 
with auxiliary information about the subject of the operation. 
The receiving part of the replicator is an FTP server, which is regularly checked for incoming events. 
There are 4 types of interactions with the OSR, though some of them are not implemented by the replicator. Let us discuss them one by one.


*   **Articles sync**

Article sync is intended for setting the rules and parameters for items which are to be stored in the OSR. 
OSR needs to know the product attributes like dimensions, temp zone, **chemical**-ity of the item, etc. 
This flow is not yet implemented in the replicator. 

The commands are as follows:
    
    *   ADD ARTICLE
    *   DEL ARTICLE
        
*   **Inbound**

Inbound flow is one of the OSR whales and responsible for adding items into the OSR. 
As the name implies, these operations include what can be called a **stock adjustment**. 
Inbound is mostly done on the Takeoff part and is expressed by Decanting UI + Inbound API. T
his type of flow includes a two-way exchange of information between the OSR and our Takeoff services. 
Incremented by containers, amounts of items can be added to the OSR or deleted from it. 
    
The supported processes are:
    
    *   ADD CONTAINER
    *   DEL CONTAINER
As a confirmation, OSR is sending a MOD CONTAINER message back to the host system (Takeoff).
    
        
*   **Outbound**

The next fundamental interaction with such a system would be involved in yielding some of the stored items according to the order designations. 
Outbound flow includes message exchange during order picking - info about target totes, picked lines, sending totes to the dispatch ramps. 

The messages which are used for outbound flow are: 
    
    *   ADD WPO
    *   ADD FP
    
Resulting messages are as follows:

    *   MARRIAGE CONTAINER
    *   MOD WPO
    *   MOD CONTAINER
    *   MOD WS
    *   ADD CONTAINER
    
        
*   **Inventory**

Last but by no means least would be the Inventory shenanigans. 
These are regular or manually initiated events which manipulate the internal state of 
the OSR and in most cases return particular sort of information to the host. 

The OSR affecting action would be a rather self-explanatory:

    *   ADD CONTAINER
    
Events which mostly matter to the host would be:

    *   MOD STOCK
    *   MOVE STOCK
    *   SUM STOCK
    *   MOD FP

## OSR Replicator
---

Having acquainted with the concept of OSR, now we can approach an emulation thereof. 
A software engineer working with a particular software has a definite head start by being able to interact with the real-life application of his product. 
Having a portable OSR nearby is a beneficial but a cumbersome opportunity due to the sheer size of the thing. 
That is where the OSR replicator comes into the spotlight. It is a virtual representation of the machine, capable 
of executing similar tasks, such as syncing product information, picking products, etc. 

Current implementation of the OSR replicator does not contain most of the prototype's features, 
but ~~we’re trying our best~~ main flows have been exhaustively covered. 
The repo link for the replicator can be found [here](https://github.com/takeoff-com/osr-emulator).


### How to basic

The replicator runs as a separate service. As it happens with the OG, in order to send an event to the replicator, 
one needs to send the event file to the FTP server. 
Most of the work within the replicator is unsurprisingly done by OSR WORKER. It is a document conveyor belt which reads the messages 
currently present on the server and executes them accordingly. 
Currently supported flows are:

* Decanting
* Picking
* Article sync
    

## Takeoff Status and Error codes in KiSoft

Based on [Status and Error codes in KiSoft](https://takeofftech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ST/pages/3503194131/TO+Status+and+Error+codes+in+KiSoft)
