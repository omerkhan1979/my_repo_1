## Life at Takeoff

It’s an exciting time to be part of Takeoff. We're a fast-growing, all-remote team, and we're looking for people to join us around the world.
Here's a look at what you can expect from our culture and [all-remote environment](/company/culture/all-remote/guide/).


## Culture at Takeoff

Culture at Takeoff is established in the following ways.

1. Work style (how we work). This is defined and articulated in [our purpose](https://takeofftech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/1058832397/Our+Purpose) and [engineering ethics](ethics/).

In other organizations, culture may be defined through the *personality of the group*. This includes people who have traits in common and people who you enjoy spending time with. Note that this is **not** something that should matter when [evaluating people for work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2015/03/17/is-cultural-fit-just-a-new-way-to-discriminate/), and this is not what we mean with Culture at Takeoff.
