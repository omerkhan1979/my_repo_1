  How we plan to keep our API design guide up to date.

---

We recognize that updates to this guide will be necessary. We plan to track
those changes using Github similar to [Google’s own
process](https://google.aip.dev/1).

This policy is stored within the [Engineering Handbook
Repo](https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook). Feel free to start a
conversation about changes you’d like to see in #guild-architecture or by
posting a PR to the repository.

The latest official policy is reflected by the master branch and viewable on the
[official handbook website](https://engineering-handbook.takeofftech.org/). Any
work in progress updates will be captured as PRs for interested parties to
contribute to.

The team reviewing and maintaining all API policy is:
- [Eugene Marcotte](https://github.com/orgs/takeoff-com/people/emarcotte)
