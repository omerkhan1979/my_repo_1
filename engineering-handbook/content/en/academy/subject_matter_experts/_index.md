A subject-matter expert (SME) is a person who is highly knowledgable and can speak authoritatively on a particular topic or area. When developing materials about a topic, the personnel developing the material rely on subject-matter experts for a source of truth.

 * Get a mentor
    * Learn new skill/technology/language/framework/etc.
    * Improve existing knowledge. For example, learn how to design database schemes for a Warehouses Solution.
