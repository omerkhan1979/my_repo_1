    Strive for Quality
---

We expect teams to always strive for high-quality code supported by testing and reasonable documentation.  This side note of a page is a simple restatement of the existing Definition of Done guidance. 

Break new work into 2 categories:
1. Nice to have, planned work and delayed hotfixes
    - Must have the highest level of automated coverage for scenarios
2. Business-critical must have work (are we going to lose money in the next weeks. This is customer attrition protection) - this is hotfixes and critical business use case misses only.
    - Debt must be called out. 

Remember, the team is responsible for the quality of delivered features, no matter how the resources are spread.
