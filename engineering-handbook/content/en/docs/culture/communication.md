  A deep dive into many areas related to Communication approach at Takeoff.
---
We are a global, hybrid-remote company that communicates in a primarily asynchronous manner across many different timezones. Because of this, effective communication is critical to our day-to-day operations and the success of our business. Communication is also vey nuanced, which is why it is worth your time to read this page carefully.  


## Takeoff Communication

As a company that spans multiple global locations, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use both  <b>asynchronous (e.g. Slack) and synchronous (Meetings) communication methods</b> staying as open and transparent as we can. 

We should ensure that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

## Effective & Responsible Communication Guidelines

1. **Assume Positive Intent.** Always begin with a position of positivity and grace. (If a message feels like a slight, assume positive intent while asking for clarification.)
1. **Kindness Matters.** You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.  (It costs nothing to be kind, even if you do not believe someone deserves it.)
1. **Express Your Thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Own It.** If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. **Be a Role Model of our Values.**
1. **Feedback is Essential.** It is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
1. **Don't Underestimate a 1:1.** Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a Meeet video call.
1. **No Ego.** Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.

Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm.

## Everyone is a Moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your **direct manager**.

## External Communication

Key practices to consider during any meeting are listed below.

1. Video Calls - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
1. Agenda - Always have an agenda prepped and ready to go. Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if thereâ€™s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring. 
1. 70/30 Rule - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions need to be asked and to capture those items.
1. Take Notes - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience's needs.
1. Adapt to Audience Tone - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.
1. Mid-call - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you're presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction.
1. Pre-Close Summary - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.
1. Post Meeting Action - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into the proper directory (Google Drive, Confluence etc.).
1. Two Block Rule - For in person meetings with external parties you should wait until you're more than two blocks from the meeting before discussing the results of the meeting. Nobody wants to hear themselves being discussed in the bathroom.

## Internal Communication

Internal communication is any work related communication at a company.
Internal Communication includes conversations between team members, wider team discussions, or internal announcements.
At Takeoff, everyone can contribute to the effectiveness of Internal Communications to support aspects of Takeoff culture, such as intentional transparency and engaging people in open dialogue.

Since we believe that all team members must be **self Managing**, most communication is handled by the relevant group, but we know that some communications are more sensitive and contentious than others.
In those cases, the you may want to engage your manager for support.

## Top Tips and Best Practices

1. All written communication happens in English, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
1. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels and [people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk).
1. If you choose to email instead of chat it is OK to send an _internal_ email that contains only a short message, similar as you would use in chat.
1. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked. See the **Add Meet Guidelines here** for more detail.
1. If you mention something (a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment, etc.) please include a link to it.
1. When someone asks something, give back a deadline or that you did it. Answers like: 'will do', 'OK', 'it is on my todo list' are not helpful. If it is small it's better to spend 2 minutes and do the tasks so the other person can mentally forget about it. If it is large you need to figure out when you'll do it, by returning that information the other person might decide to solve it in another way if it takes too long.
1. It is OK to bring an issue to someone's attention with a CC ("cc @user"), but CCs alone are not enough if specific action is needed from someone. The mentioned user may read the issue and take no further action. If you need something, please explicitly communicate your need along with @ mentioning who you need it from.
1. Avoid creating private groups for internal discussions:
   1. It's disturbing (all users in the group get notified for each message).
   1. It's not searchable.
   1. It's not shareable: there is no way to add people in the group (and this often leads to multiple groups creation).
   1. They don't have a subject, so everyone has to remember the topic of each private group based on the participants, or open the group again to read the content.
1. When discussing concepts, be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.

### How to make a Company wide Announcement

1. Consider the subject and the audience.
   Questions you might want to ask yourself: Is this relevant to all team members globally?
   Is this something important, urgent and high priority? Is there a better place for this communication, such as a more informal Slack channel?
1. Keep it simple, brief and summarize what is important. Cover the 5 W's. What, Why, Who, When, Where (you can also add How, if required as a call to action).
1. Common company wide announcements include (but are not limited to): organization changes, policy iterations, requests to participate in a company survey, unveiling the next Takeoff Contribute location, codebase migrations, process improvement and security/safety announcements.

### Ask Me Anything Meetings

**Ask Me Anything meetings** can be a useful opportunity for team members to meet a new leader, learn more about an existing team member, or gain clarity on a recent change.

## Cross-Link

Linking should not be in one direction. We should go beyond deep-linking to create a richer web of links that can surface content and ensure people consider all pages when making updates. When linking one page to another, try to link back as well. Instead of only linking from Page A to Page B, both link Page A to Page B and link Page B back to Page A. 

## Presentations

1. All presentations are made in Google Slides using **add Link to templates**
1. If there are introductions being performed please make sure that nobody is presenting. We remember people better and have more empathy when we clearly see peoples faces and expressions.
1. At the end of the presentation when you go to Q&A stop presenting in Meet. This way the other people can see the person who is speaking much better.
1. When your presentation includes graphs or other data, make sure your graphs have clear titles and dimensions. Make sure your data has significant figures and labels. Keep in mind that your audience may not have the full context, especially if they are reading the presentation asynchronously.

## Say Thanks

Recognition is a key and transformative tactic. Thanking team members provides an opportunity for them to be recognized for their contributions, influences engagement behavior, and acknowledges to team members their work is seen. 

1. Thank people that did a great job in our `#kudos` [Slack channel](https://takeofftech.slack.com/archives/CH0DLK1MY). 
1. Consider other channels where recognition can be acknowledged: team meetings, issues, company calls, 1-1 meetings, etc.
1. If someone is a team member just `@`-mention them, if multiple people were working on something try `@`-mentioning each person.
1. Please be as timely as possible with your recognition.
1. If possible please include a link with your thanks that points to the subject matter that you are giving thanks for.
1. Please do not mention working outside of working hours, we want to minimize the pressure to do so.
1. Don't thank the CEO or other executives for something that the company paid for, thank Takeoff instead.
1. Understand that everyone doesn't need or want recognition. Once this is advised, please respect when they don't.

## Effective Listening

It is estimated that listeners will filter out or change the intended meaning of what is heard in 70% of all communications. [Source](https://1personalcareercoach.com/art-listening-good-leader).

**Myths about Listening**

- Everybody knows how to listen.
- Sending messages is more important than receiving them.
- Listening is easy and passive.
- Hearing and listening are the same thing.
- An effective speaker commands audience attention.
- Communication is the senderâ€™s responsibility.
- Listening is done with our ears.
- Listening skills are practiced and not learned.
- Listening ability comes from maturity.

**Tips for Effective Listening**

- Concentrate.
- Give unequivocal attention to the speaker.
- Donâ€™t anticipate what the speaker means.
- Test the message not the messenger.
- Respect cultural difference and boundaries.
- Develop the fine art of empathy.
- Try not to interrupt.
- Focus on feelings and not grammar or vocabulary.
- Silence is the golden rule.

**Being Assertive**

There is a delicate balance between being confident enough to be assertive of personal rights and boundaries while respectful of others.

- Know the distinction between being assertive and being aggressive or arrogant.
- Establish clear boundaries when dealing with others.
- Politely but directly let people know your position.
- Know what you want.
- Avoid being timid.
- Be willing to clearly say either yes or no and stand by your answer.
- Avoid arrogance.
- When opinions are in question give yourself permission to disclose yours.

## Scheduling Meetings

1. If you want to schedule an event please check attendees availability in Google calendar before creating it. Calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and memberâ€™s status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.
1. If you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only after they respond yes. Then invite outside people.
1. When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer meetings of 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time in between meetings to: 
   1. Write notes and reflect 
   1. Respond to urgent messages 
   1. Take a [bio break](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bio-break-meaning-and-origin) 
   1. Stretch your legs 
   1. Grab a snack
1. When scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees' calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.
1. Scrum events should be created in the Takeoff Scrum Events calendar, excluding Sprint Reviews which should be created in the Takeoff Sprint Reviews Calendar.
1. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option **Delete & update guests** to make sure everyone knows you can't attend and don't wait for you. 

## Indicating Availability

**Google**

Indicate your availability by updating your own calendar using Google's ["out of office"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510656/google-calendar-out-of-office-option) feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select unless you uncheck the box.

1. Put your planned away time including holidays, vacation, travel time, and other leave in your own calendar.
1. Set your working hours in your Google Calendar settings.

**Slack**
1. Set you slack profile status to indicate the timezone that you are working in or sick / vacationing status
   *  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Country flag you are currently working from
   * ðŸ¤’ Out sick
   * ðŸŒ´ Vacationing
2. You can also update the timezone settings from Edit Profile, so that if someone is trying to reach out to you at an odd time they are notified from slack of you current time.
## Video Calls

1. Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email or over chat. Guideline: if you have gone **back and forth 3 times**, it's time for a video call.
1. Try to have your video on at all times because it's much more engaging for participants
   1. During internal calls, it's okay to eat on video if you're hungry or the call is during your lunch time (please turn your mic off). To maintain professionalism, if you are presenting or facilitating a customer call please try to avoid eating. If eating during a customer call is unavoidable, please turn off your video and mute your mic.
   1. You should ensure that you are properly dressed for all video calls. Properly dressed means that you are wearing clothing that covers the top and bottom parts of your body. We do not have a strict dress code policy, but want to make sure that all participants on video calls feel comfortable. If you cannot be properly dressed for the entirety of the call, you should not join, but watch the recording at a later time.
   1. Having pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during video chats is encouraged. If they are human, ask them to wave at your remote team member to say ["Hi in your native language"](https://www.araioflight.com/hello-in-different-languages-world/).
   1. Do not feel forced to have your video on, use your best judgement.
1. Additional points for video calls with customers or partners
   1. Results come first. Your appearance, location and background is less important than making customers successful so don't wait for the perfect time / place when you can engage a customer right away.
   1. Communicating that the Takeoff solution is enterprise grade and service provider is supported by the way you present yourself. Most of the time, if you would not wear something or present yourself in a certain way at a customer's office, candidate interview, or partner meeting in person then it's probably not the right choice on a video call with them either.
   1. Green screens are a great background solution. It's great to work in your garage or basement! Just get a green screen behind you and put up a professional background image to present well externally and still use the rest of the room how you want!
1. We Use **Google Meet** 
1. When you add attendees, Google Calendar will add a Meet link for a video call to the invite
1. [Hybrid calls are horrible](#hybrid-calls-are-horrible)
1. Always be sure to advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker is able to be heard by all attendees.
1. We start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the scheduled minute of the meeting (before :01 if it is scheduled for :00). The question 'is everyone here' is not needed.
1. We end on the scheduled time. It might feel rude to end a meeting, but you're actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.
1. It is unusual to smoke in an open office or video conference, vaping is associated with this. For this reason we ask that you don't vape during calls, and if you absolutely have to, kindly switch your camera off.
1. Speak up when you notice something is not working. If you notice someone's microphone, web cam or latency is causing issues for them it is good to speak up. On a video call it can be harder for the speaker to notice that they aren't being understood compared to a face to face conversation. As such you will be doing them a favour by speaking up early to let them know that they are having a problem. Also see [Hear nothing say something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5spXU5HbU) for further explanation.

## Hybrid calls are horrible

In calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen).

When multiple people share equipment the following **problems arise for remote participants**:

1. Can't hear the sharing people well.
1. Background noise since the microphone of the sharing people on all the time.
1. Can't clearly see facial expressions since each face takes up only a small part of the screen.
1. Can't easily see who is talking since the screen shows multiple people.
1. Hard getting a word in since their delay is longer than for the sharing people.

The **people sharing equipment also have problems** because they don't have their own equipment:

1. Can't easily screen share something themselves.
1. Trouble seeing details in screen sharing since the screen is further away from them.
1. Can't scroll through a slide deck at their own pace.
1. Sharing people can't easily participate (view or type) in a shared document with the agenda and meeting notes.

The disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people.
The disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience.
The extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy.

Theoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms:

1. It is annoying to first hear someone talk in the room and then hear it over audio with a delay.
1. It is hard to consistently mute yourself when not talking to prevent someone else's voice coming through your microphone as well.

## User Communication Guidelines

1. Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
1. If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. 
1. There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You donâ€™t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.

1. **Assume positive intent** and explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. [Rapoport's Rules](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules) also implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.
1. Answer questions, thank people even if itâ€™s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
1. Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
1. Don't make promises that you can't keep.
1. Guide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links. 
1. When facing negative comments, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into the strongest supporters.

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. Don't use ALL CAPS because it [feels like shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting).
2. Avoid ellipsis ("...") because, like all caps, it feels rude or sarcastic.  
3. Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have [meaningful links](https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/links-should-have-meaningful-anchor-text-heres-why/).
4. If you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them. Numbered lists are easier to reference during a discussion over bulleted lists.
5. When you reference an issue, merge request, comment, commit, page, doc, etc. and you have the URL available please paste that in. 
6. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term. Example: instead of `MR`, write `merge request (MR)`.
   1. If acronyms are used, expand them at least once in the conversation or document and define them in the document. Alternatively, link to the definition.


## Simple Language

Simple Language is meant to encourage everyone at Takeoff to simplify the language we use.
We should always use the most clear, straightforward, and meaningful words possible in every conversation.
Avoid using "fluff" words, jargon, or "corporate-speak" phrases that don't add value.

When you **don't** use Simple Language, you:

- Confuse people and create a barrier for participants of your conversation.
- Cause others to not speak up in a meeting because they don't understand what you're saying.
- Are not inclusive of those whose first language is not English.
- Do not add value with your words.

When you **do** use Simple Language, you:

- Get work done more efficiently.
- Build credibility with your audience (your team, coworker, customer, etc.).
- Keep people's attention while you're speaking.
- Come across more confident and knowledgeable.

**Here's an example:**

_Original sentence_

> We're now launching an optimization of our approach leveraging key learnings from the project's postmortem.

_A Simple Language sentence_

> We're creating a new plan based on what we learned from this project.

Simple Language is important both when we're speaking to other team members and when we're representing Takeof to people outside the company.

Be sure to use Simple Language in written communications as well.
Our handbook, website, docs, marketing materials, and candidate or customer emails should be clear, concise, and effective.

## Email

1. Send one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).
1. Always reply to emails by replying to all, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.
1. Close the loop. If you email someone with a request or question, and you receive a response that contains everything you need, send a quick final reply, even if its just a quick thanks. Not responding can convey rudeness, disrespect, dissatisfaction with the response, or that you didnt receive the response.         
1. If you're sending an email to a large group of people (or a distribution list), put those recipients in BCC (rather than in the "To" field) so that a reply all won't ping hundreds of people.
1. Only Corporate IT is allowed to provision Google Groups and email distributions.
1. Emails are asynchronous, for example, if your manager emails you on a weekend it is fine to reply during the workweek.
1. If an email is or has become **urgent** feel free to ping people via chat referencing the subject of the email.
1. Where appropriate, consider using professional salutations including Hi or Hello and avoid colloquial expressions such as Hey, Oh, or Sup. Sometimes only the person's name is suitable. The level of formality should often mirror the formality from previous messages when communicating with internal team members as well as external persons.
1. Try to always use a person's name when starting or responding to a message, especially if there are multiple persons cc'd, so that the addressee knows you are addressing them.
1. Proofread your messages so that sentences are punctuated correctly, typos are fixed, and grammar is corrected.
1. All messages and replies are signed with a professional send-off (ex. Best regards), your name, and your signature block.

## Slack

Slack is to be used for informal communication only. Accordingly, Slack should specifically NOT be used for:

1. obtaining approvals;
1. documenting decisions;
1. storing official company records or documents; or
1. sharing personal or sensitive information regarding any individuals

Internal slack messages between team members are still considered professional communication. Please do not use or add emoji's to slack that are of a political, religious or of a sexual nature. When in doubt do not use or add the emoji. If you have any concerns about an emoji that was used, please reach out to the author or if you are not comfortable doing so please reach out to your manager.

### Be respectful of your own time

1. You should try to avoid information overload in order to be productive and efficient with your time. While it can be tempting to read every message in every Slack channel you subscribe to, itâ€™s very challenging, not expected, and not necessary.
1. One method for avoiding Slack overload is to focus your Slack reading on [Starred channels](https://slack.com/intl/en-nl/help/articles/201331016-Star-channels-and-direct-messages) and [Threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-). Starred channels are like "favorites" and allow you to follow messages from those channels easily. Threads consist of any conversation in which you are mentioned and allow you to easily track conversations in which you have direct involvement.
1. Use your notification settings liberally. Depending on how you use Slack this could range from limiting notifications to critical messages outside of your working hours to turning off Slack notifications entirely. Find the right balance for you and stick to it.

### Be respectful of others' time

1. Start by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It's about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration. The following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context.
1. If you're only referring to someone, but don't actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without `@` mentioning them.
1. Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
1. Because we work globally, you may receive Slack mentions at any time of day. Please consider enabling [Slack's Do not disturb functionality](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb) so you don't get interrupted, for example, in your offtime. You can also use Slack's Notification schedule tool, this can be found in Slack's Preferences tab. To access this, open slack, hover your cursor at the top of your screen, click slack, then preferences, under the notifications tab you will see notification schedule. This tool allows you to pick what days / times you get notifications.
1. Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
1. Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
1. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to `@mention` a specific team ([Slack User Group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group#browse-user-groups-and-view-members)), consider the size of the group you are mentioning and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:
   1. Use `@here` to notify all currently _active_ members in the room. Please only use `@here` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
   1. Use `@channel` to notify _ALL_ members in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use `@channel` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
1. If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.

### Managing noise and creating focus in Slack

Slack can be a disorderly place in its default state. Consider implementing the below to add structure and focus, but remember that there will likely be more useful information shared on Slack than you are able to ingest and process on a daily basis, regardless of your approach.

While an intentional effort to organize is important, remember that **it's impossible to know everything**. As a team, we may spot information that is missed by others, and we should surface that information when pertinent as we strive to **see others succeed**. For managing Slack channels, consider blocking a set period of time to review certain channels that makes the most sense for you (i.e. multiple times a day, daily, weekly).

#### Organizing your Slack sidebar by priority

Consider using Slack's <b>[Starred channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201331016-Star-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> function to spotlight three categories of channels, its <b>[Mute function](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> to quiet channels which are pulling your focus away too often, and most importantly, its **Mark all messages as read** function (easily toggled by pressing `Shift` and `Esc` simultaneously while on a desktop) to achieve an instantly clear slate.

#### Manage your Slack notifications

Below are helpful links to best practices and tips on managing your notifications and reducing noise in Slack. We encourage you to regularly check your notification settings to ensure you get more notifications of what _is_ important/relevant to you, and less of what _isn't_.

#### Set aside time to work through notifications

Building dedicated time into your day can help minimize the distractions that Slack can create. Consider using a 15 or 30 minute block in your morning or afternoon to enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up on messages you might have missed. When the time you set comes to an end, close out of the Slack app and move on to your next project. Having a set end time can help you feel more in control, and serves as a reminder that [it's impossible to know everything](/handbook/values/#its-impossible-to-know-everything)

### General Guidelines

1. Everyone can contribute, and while opinions are important to provide perspective, we value **proposals** and **iteration**. 
1. In general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal (or in Slack, written) response might be too much.
1. In public channels, [**threads**](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) are valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.
1. Unless you're in an active chat, don't break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use [**threads**](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) if you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.
1. If you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to `Preferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...` and "send me email notifications."
1. When sharing Slack messages _within_ Slack, prefer using the 'Share' function rather than copying the link and pasting that into another channel. With 'Share', the original message will be displayed in the destination allowing recipients to read it directly, as compared to a link which they must at least hover-over to get a brief snippet, and click on to read the entire message (taking them to the other channel).
   1. To 'Share message', hover over the message and in the tooltip box that appears on the right of the window, click on the right-facing arrow icon.
1. When selecting your Slack display name, please do not have your name in all capital letters as this is often [associated as shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting) in written communications.

## Google Meet
Takeoff uses Google meet as the primary video collaboration platform for internal and external communications. Some of our customers and partners have different preferred tools.

Google meet Etiquette

1. If you want to comment/ input/ speak please use the raise hand function so that the facilitator is aware and can ensure you get to speak.  If the facilitator advises at the beginning of the meeting that you do not need to do this then it is Ok to just speak out.

1. Be present, do not continue to work on other things, be on your phone messaging people in slack during the meeting.  This can be distracting and also insulting to the meeting facilitator an other attendees.

1. Ensure that there is an agenda / purpose for the meeting included in the description / invite so the attendee can decide if the meeting is of value to them or that they feel they can add value.

1. Provide feedback to meeting owner if you are declining a meeting. Do not just decline.

## Google Calendar

We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to 'Make available for Takeoff Technologies Inc - See all event details'. Consider marking the following appointments as 'Private':

1. Personal appointments.
1. Confidential & sensitive meetings.


There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone:

1. Transparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of "be open about as many things as possible".
1. Due to our timezone differences, there are small windows of time when our availabilities overlap. If other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member.

If you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. "Check Google Analytics"), consider marking yourself "Free" for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can't find another convenient time.
