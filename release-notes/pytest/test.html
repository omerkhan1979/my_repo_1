  <h3>Fixed Bug(s)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>OUTBOUND-3473\n</strong><br><span> This resolves the bug where orders where
    not re-enqueued when the "Clear Session" functionality was utilized. This
    tool will now work as expected: after selecting "Clear Session", the order
    is unassigned from the current picker and then re-enqueued into the manual
    queue so that another user is able to assign/pick the order. </span>

  <h3>Improvement(s)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>OUTBOUND-3341<br>Version: RT52-22<br>Product Area(s): Dispatch</strong><br><span> A new configuration around the split mechanism
    has been created in TSC to improve the creation of new environments. This
    method no longer requires creating a Pull Request (PR)/deployment. Additionally
    as part of this increment, orders created with no recognized/in-stock lines
    will be moved to `served` status immediately after the order splits. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>OUTBOUND-3129</strong><br><span> This new shipping label display was configured
    for specifically for SMU (LAM001) based on the clients feedback. The main
    changes are:<br>
    - Removed concatenation `DE+zone-id+zone-seq-num`<br>
    - Reduced emphasis on the spoke's ID<br>
    - Increased emphasis on the route's ID<br>
    - The route's stop number was added under the route's ID<br>
    - The date format is DD/MM/YYYY<br>
    - The order's ID length is maxed to 16 characters </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>INC-769</strong><br><span> This feature relates to the case, when new user
    tries to signin to TOM, but had not yet received a role. Instead of a page
    with error, it sees a nice page explaining that it must be granted a role
    to use TOM UI. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>INBOUND-2281</strong><br><span> Starting in this release, as part of the
    Known Address Infrastructure (KAI) project, we have added additional logic
    to ensure manual area adjustments only occur on known addresses within the
    MFC. Please note, this logic is hidden behind a Feature Flag coupled with
    the KAI project. </span>
