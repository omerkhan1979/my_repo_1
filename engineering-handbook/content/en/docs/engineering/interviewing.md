Takeoff Technologies believes in the importance of building diverse teams with a varied skill set and perspective as well as providing the right motivation and the means for teams to solve difficult problems. We hire not just for skill and experience, but also for humility and [growth mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU). The rest of this document outlines how we find the right people.

Regardless of office, Takeoff Engineering uses a unified global process to identify and hire top Engineering talent that we believe fits with our [core values][1]. We use [Lever](https://hire.lever.co/) as our Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to make sure that we are staying on top of providing the best interview experience possible for our candidates.

Lever is set up to provide the ability to comment on and provide feedback for candidates in job roles in which you are assigned either as a Recruiter, Hiring Manager, or a member of the interview team. Sensitive information can be shared confidentially using Lever ensuring that the right people have the right access.

### FAQ

> "As a current Takeoff employee, can I apply for a different role within the company?"

Yes - we try our best to provide opportunities for upward as well as lateral movement at Takeoff. We ask that you please inform your manager of this intent prior to submitting your application for consideration. While internal transfers may be given special consideration, candidates will still be expected to go through the standard interview process to fairly evaluate fitness for the role.

<!--

Takeoff uses internal recruiters to source our candidates. Outside recruiting requires specific approval and you can feel free to ignore requests from agencies. We use Lever as our candidate tracking system. Our aim is to evaluate each candidate, not just on the immediate need for the role but on a wider future contribution to our mission. At the same time we want to provide a thorough and enjoyable interview for the candidates without dragging out the process. To this goal our general plan is:

Takeoff Recruiting will source candidates or review referrals, direct applications
The designated Hiring Manager will review each candidate and do a first behavioral interview. Based on the managerâ€™s interview a take home project will be assigned. An interview panel and areas of coverage will be conveyed.
On return of the take home assignment the technical interviewers will evaluate the code and a Technical Interview will be scheduled.
A follow up behavioral interview will also be conducted.
As close to the technical and behavioral interviews a meeting will be scheduled to discuss the candidate and this will trigger an offer to join Takeoff.
Responsibilities
Recruiter
Hiring Manager
Working with the Recruiter to refine candidate search criteria
Writing and refining the job descriptions to be published externally
Staffing the Interview Panel and making sure each interviewer understands their role on the team
Tweaking interview process to find the right candidate for the job
Facilitating wrap-up sessions
Interview Panel
Deciding whether or not any given candidate is the right fit for the role
Evaluating candidates along a either technical or behavioral axis
Reviewing any take-home work assigned to the candidate
Sharing thoughts/observations with the rest of the interview team to have a well-rounded perspective on the candidate

Take home project thoughts
Hiring and onboarding new employees is a rewarding and intensive process which is not without costs. Our aim is to evaluate each candidate on their technical ability, but also their ability to work with our teams. The take home project lets each candidate put their best foot forward in a language of their choice but it is not as much about the code as it is about evaluating how each candidate works with the technical interviewers as if they were already on the team and reviewing a technical solution. We aim to see how they give and receive feedback, as well as to see if this is someone that our engineers would enjoy working with.

For those candidates who decline a take home project will assign a problem in the interview and attempt to work on it live with the applicant.
