  Career Ladders at Takeoff.
---

### Corporate Levels

There are seven levels in Takeoff across every department from the most junior hires to the most senior. There is no true standard path up the ladder. In fact, normally people at the “top” of the ladder have spent time in multiple engineering disciplines and sometimes in non-engineering disciplines as well. 

Well-rounded-ness tends to be a valuable skill in many leadership positions. However, it is completely possible to move up the Takeoff career ladder by staying hyper-focused on a particular engineering discipline. So whether your path wanders horizontally across different titles, levels and roles or straight up and down in a particular discipline it is likely achievable here at Takeoff given you have the skill, the will, the desire and the grit to make it happen.

### Engineering Levels

Here is how those seven levels map to the engineering organization and its disciplines. The description attempt to be broad so as to be inclusive of as many disciplines as possible (but at times it is not a perfect mapping).
