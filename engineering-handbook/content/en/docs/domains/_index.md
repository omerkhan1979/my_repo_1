## Domains
Domains are our logical groupings of business responsibilities for the Takeoff solution.

A trio of three disciplines oversee and are accountable for any given domain:
- Director of Engineering
- Director of Product
- Architect

A domain can be staffed by one or more cross-functional scrum/kanban teams.
