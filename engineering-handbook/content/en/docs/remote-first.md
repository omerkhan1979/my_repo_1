# Remote-First Engineering Organization


 ![Takeoff MFC Image](/images/en/docs/remote-first/takeoffmfc.png)

## Remote-First Engineering Organization

Takeoff Technologies is a remote-first engineering organization. As a remote-first organization, we optimize our workplaces for remote. We prioritize creating documentation, policies, and workflows that work when assuming that 100% of the organization is remote, even if some continue to occasionally visit a company owned office.

At the same time we encourage our teams to meet in person as much as the team feels is beneficial. This may not be at a corporate office, however there is increased benefit to the team and innovation from meeting regularly.

### Remote-first vs. remote friendly

A remote-first workplace, working outside of a corporate office is the default mode of working rather than an exception or occasional practice.

This is different from a “remote-friendly” company, which enables some employees to work outside of the corporate office for various reasons, but still conducts most of its daily operations in person. A remote-friendly company might allow employees to work remotely a certain number of days a week, or hire remote staff for specific roles, but this is not the overall organization’s primary mode of working.

Remote-first companies, craft their operations around a consistent employee experience no matter where the person is working. In practice, a remote-first company assumes a fully remote workforce and sets up its operations to be able to run consistently and effectively regardless of where people are at any given moment.

A remote-friendly company allows employees to work outside of the corporate office at least part of the time; a remote-first company assumes employees are working outside of the corporate office all of the time.

### Why remote-first?

Companies adopt a remote-first work policy to support a variety of short-term and long-term business goals. These include business continuity, talent recruiting and retention, financial savings, employee wellness, and long-term flexibility and adaptability. While there are certainly some businesses and industries that still require some degree of face-to-face interaction, modern technologies and business culture have made remote-first a very attainable—and in some cases preferable—way of working for some organizations.

### Remote-first benefits

Companies typically become remote-first workplaces because they see clear-cut business advantages in this way of working. Remote-first benefits include:

**Improved employee satisfaction:** Remote-first employees often report boosts in their overall outlook on work. Reducing or eliminating commuting time and transportation costs is a good example of how remote-first environments can enhance quality of life.

**Long-term flexibility:** Remote-first in general enables a company to be able to grow without worrying as much about the constraints of its physical spaces. A high-growth firm does not constantly need to be adding office space and equipment to keep pace with its hiring.

Moreover, companies can more readily adapt to changing conditions without being concerned about wasting spending on physical infrastructure. Similarly, remote-first is a boon for business continuity planning, since companies already have the tools and culture in place needed to successfully achieve their business goals even when employees cannot access a central headquarters or workplace.

## Language of the Company

English is the official language of Engineering at Takeoff. Fluency is required.

## Development Centers

We take pride in our culture and identity as a leader in hyper-local micro fulfillment for eGrocery. At Takeoff, we work together to execute, but more importantly innovate. This is a very different model to contract or task oriented engineering groups that can work in isolation on distinct tasks or features. While we are Remote-First we are not a [nomadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad) engineering team so as to maintain our culture, ties and values in delivering innovative software solutions.

Takeoff Engineering has 3 main development centers; Waltham MA (United States), Kyiv (Ukraine), Pune (India) and our engineers align with the local cultures, holidays and ties to their local teams.


## Working Timezones

Engineering at Takeoff is a team sport. We work in a hybrid agile environment and the teams commit to the work they will be accomplishing in the next iteration. As the team is signing themselves up for that sprint’s goal it is important that they are able to work together to create the increment.

Takeoff works in 3 time zones globally; Eastern Standard Time, Eastern European Time & India Standard Time. We require the teams to work together in one of these time zones and be able to attend all agile events with their team and Domains as needed.

Our work is not limited to discrete tickets and often there are inter-team, inter-domain or cross-domain dependencies that may require coordination that having known working hours helps to simplify.

## Documentation

Remote-First organizations like Takeoff Engineering succeed through documentation. This requires every team member to be equally invested in perpetuating documentation, which will create a cycle of self-searching, self-service and self-learning.

Knowing where to look is critical to our success. As we build a remote-first organization and culture we must ensure our decisions and actions are documented and discoverable. As we have not always been great at documenting before executing this is an ongoing process. We maintain a [Takeoff Engineering Handbook](https://engineering-handbook.takeofftech.org/) driven by Github.

Our goal is to assume that your question is already answered and for everyone to search by default in the Engineering Handbook before asking a team member. The follow on to this is to add the missing information as it is answered so the next person is able to discover the information. This can be a major behavioral change for those who have come from a colocation working environment and will require a retraining to force yourself to search first without defaulting to asking a friend. Keep in mind that we are all working on this change together.

## Hiring For Remote-First

Takeoff Engineering’s goal is to hire the best engineers for the roles we are looking to fill and not restricting our hiring to a specific location increases our scope of candidates. That being said, we will aim to hire teams in clusters where we can. Keeping engineering as a team sport in mind, we strongly believe that giving teams the ability to meet face-to-face as often as they deem productive is very beneficial.

As Takeoff grows our remote team, we consider these tips:

 - Communicate transparently to candidates. The hiring process shouldn’t
   be a mystery. Set expectations for both yourself and the candidate at
   the beginning of the process to allow them to focus on whether the
   role and the company are right for them, while you evaluate that too.
  - Look for qualities that make a strong remote-first employee. Those
   include timeliness, dependability, respect, collaboration,
   perseverance, empathy, kindness, and ambition. Look for candidates
   with excellent communication skills and an appreciation for
   self-learning, self-service, and autonomy.
   
   - Use video calls to engage with candidates. Knock down some barriers
   to communication with video conferencing. Inform candidates ahead of
   time that the call will be through video, to give them time to
   prepare and ensure a stable internet connection.
   
   - Where possible we will make use of co-working or office space for
   onboarding new engineers to our teams. These spaces will also be
   available for teams to meet as often as they would like and again to
   promote our team sport approach to engineering at Takeoff.

## Interviews

  

With covid case counts reaching manageable numbers, many companies are going back to office. With this change in expectation, we anticipate there will be a good number of top Engineering talent from other tech companies who have gotten used to working in a remote world and will start to look for other opportunities elsewhere to continue working remotely ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/64percent-of-workers-would-consider-quitting-if-asked-to-return-to-office-full-time.html)). Enter Takeoff. We have decided to stand up remote-first teams to stay competitive for talent. This means that we must treat remote employees as first class citizens, providing every opportunity for building connections as those who regularly visit an office.

Interviewing to build remote teams requires some additional consideration:

-   What are the leadership qualities to look for when seeding a remote team?
    
-   How do we find individuals who will facilitate team bonding and establish mutual trust?
    
-   How often does it make sense for any given team to get together to facilitate team bonding? Monthly? Quarterly?
    
-   Is there an epicenter where a fully remote team can gather easily? (ie. WeWork, MFC, remote satellite office, etc.)
    
Some questions to ask to see how the candidate approaches remote work:

-   What are the challenges you see that remote teams must face and what do you believe is needed for a mix of local and remote teams within a company to succeed?
    
-   How do you establish trust with your teammates in a remote world?
    
-   How often (if at all) would you want to get together with your team? Monthly? Quarterly?
    
-   What are the ingredients to a successful remote-first team?
    
-   What are indicators of a healthy remote-first team? Unhealthy remote-first team?
 
We want to approach building remote-first teams thoughtfully and adjust our interview process as such to accommodate new challenges that this strategy brings.

## When Do We Meet?

Our plans for Remote-First include planning how and when we actually meet face-to-face. As many of us have seen with being remote we are able to execute work but much of the planning and discussions seem to take a bit longer and miss some context. By providing opportunities to meet at the Engineering Organization, Domain & Team levels we aim to improve our planning, dependencies and generally have a great time! Afterall Takeoff is composed of wonderful people and there is always fun and learning to be had when we gather. Use the following as guidelines, obviously outside influences will affect timing, etc..

**Engineering Organization:** Our goal will be to gather the entire engineering team to a single location at a yearly cadence. The goal of this gathering will be to set organizational goals, engineering planning and to build teamwork. Domains and individual teams will also be able to make use of this meeting.

**Domains:** We will aim to have Domains meet twice a year. One of these will be included with the Engineering Organization meet up and the second will be roughly six months later. Again the goals of this meet up will be to set specific engineering goals for the domain that is meeting and roughly plan the following six months. Building teamwork is also a large aspect of this meet up.

**Teams:** While we are Remote-First we do our best to build teams that are collocated. The aim is that teams can decide when and how often they would like to meet in person. Takeoff will provide meeting space and encouragement. Sometimes an hour with a whiteboard can head off months of extra work.

## Your Office

Takeoff will provide a company laptop and accessories. You provide the space to work with a bit of assistance. Takeoff will reimburse office supplies, desk, camera, chair, etc.. check with your hiring manager on allowances.

How to successfully work remotely:

1.  Create a dedicated workspace (focus)
    
2.  Separate work from life (avoid burnout)
    
3.  Keep engaging with people (avoid loneliness)
    
4.  Respect routine, but experiment with change (balance)
    
5.  Be flexible and roll with the changes (iteration)
