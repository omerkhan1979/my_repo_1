  Things the guild has been asked to investigate but has not yet gotten to.

☢️ This page contains many fragments of notes the API guild has collected during
its investigation of other topics. The content of the list is not sorted, not
polished and probably more confusing than useful.

If you have any interest in something listed here please feel free to propose
some updates to the guide!

- Once we have more skill with running Apigee or other gateway services, we may
  find we need to start testing our proxy definitions and configuration. This
  will likely involve some sort of generic HTTP testing framework + stub
  servers. https://github.com/apickli/apickli is one tool that come up in this
  area.
- https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760068035
- Is Heirachy the right way to describe it? https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r759628778
- Improve how we explain which resource NAMES exist in the APIs a service
  provide: https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r759639959
- **This one has come up** Unique resources/cross collection?  [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0159.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0159.md)
- Include more examples of how to document attributes that have "kinds" that may
  change/be added to in future
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760068035
- Generally document retention policies for resources
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760185015
- Domain modeling
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760199209
- Resources having alias/deprecated names between API versions:
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760204116
- Call out separation of API behaviors from business logic in Testing discussion
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760221131
- Get way more specific on request/response structures for standard verbs
  https://github.com/takeoff-com/engineering-handbook/pull/328/files#r760278404

### Everything else

- https://google.aip.dev/216 states

- Query string usage
  > @artem Maybe not related exactly to this one, but all settings should be in
  > query-string, especially for reports. As an example: calyx
  > https://calyx.tom.takeoff.com/feature-flags, whenever you apply any settings
  > they are not described in the URL so it's hard to share with someone

- Retry handling https://google.aip.dev/194 and
  https://google.aip.dev/client-libraries/4221
- [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0124.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0124.md) relationships with parent
- Webhooks (didn’t read thoroughly yet, might not even be relevant) [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/aog/3010.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/aog/3010.md)
- [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2712.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2712.md) Completeness?
- [https://google.aip.dev/163](https://google.aip.dev/163) “Validation” - e.g. “Dear computer, would this work?
- Etag delete/”I know the latest rev” [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0135.md#protected-delete](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0135.md#protected-delete)
- Delete if existing [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0135.md#delete-if-existing](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0135.md#delete-if-existing)
- May-to-many
  [https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0124.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/general/0124.md)
- Hypermedia-ish:
[https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2718.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2718.md)

  Data model?
- explicit structures
- Avoid “any” types
[https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2717.md](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/blob/master/aip/apps/2717.md)

  Avoid sharing tied into Types.
