                    </strong> <br> 
                    <span>This change introduces the following improvements to Webhooks:<br/>
- Webhook will not redeliver for 4xx class errors. Previously, we required retailers to ack messages that they didn&#39;t know about. With this change, they are now able to send us a 404 so that we do not continue to retry.<br/>
- Webhook will retry to deliver failed webhooks only.<br/>
- The redelivery from TOM UI will retry only the selected webhook.<br/>
- A new webhook added in TOM UI will start receiving events within 5 minutes due to added caching.</span>

                         <br>Product Area(s): Decanting 
                    </strong> <br> 
                    <span>This change removes an unnecessary warning message a user receives when decanting after selecting Decant From Store. Users will no longer be presented with a warning message for products not belonging in the OSR (e.g. “We recommend this item go on the shop floor”) when they select Decant From Store if the product has a sleeping area outside of the OSR. They will continue to see this warning when they select Decant With PO or Decant without PO. This will remove an irrelevant warning and reduce alert fatigue for when warnings are actual useful and should be considered.</span>
