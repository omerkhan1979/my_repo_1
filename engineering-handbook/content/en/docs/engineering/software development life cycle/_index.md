## Software Development Life Cycle Policy
All Takeoff Engineering teams, software partners, and third party contractors are expected to follow the SDLC Process in order to facilitate enterprise level code collaboration and promotion of written code to client-accessible environments including but not limited to application, testing, and infrastructure software. Every business decision and corresponding software addition, change, and deletion must be auditable and records must be retained and reportable for a minimum period of 1 year.

Code submitted must be:
   - Reviewed and approved by at least two qualified Software Engineers separate from the submitter
   - Tested and approved by at least one qualified Quality Engineer separate from the submitter and reviewer
   - Tracked with an approved set of organization-managed transition statuses and timestamps throughout the delivery process

## SDLC Process Workflow Description

{{% alert %}} **Issue** is the name used by Jira for each ticket, these can be of any type e.g. Stories; Dev tasks; QA Tasks etc.

**Developers** in scrum is term for all scrum team members excluding the Product Owner and the Scrum Master {{% /alert %}}

All project work begins with the creation of one or more Issues in Jira. These issues, describing the aspects of the work, are typically written by a **Domain Leader**, but anyone with an idea or suggestion is always welcome to contribute (with the blessing of the **Domain Leadership**). New issues enter the workflow in the **Backlog**.  Issues in the **Backlog** are selected as <span class="boxed_grey"> READY TO REFINE</span> when the Leadership are ready for the issues to be refined by the team.
Up to 2 issues should be selected for discussion at daily refinement sessions and these are moved to the <span class="boxed_grey">REFINEMENT</span> status when work to refine them has begun. Once issues have been refined and they met the Definition of Ready, they are moved to the <span class="boxed_grey">REFINED</span> status and are prioritised in the backlog ready for consideration for an upcoming sprint.

During the team **Sprint Planning** meeting, issues that are prioritised at the top of the Product Backlog may be scheduled for implementation in a future sprint. Issues that have been selected for the sprint are moved to status <span class="boxed_grey">SELECTED TO DO</span> typically by the **Scrum Master**, but any team member can do this.  The **developers** then develop their sprint plan and the sprint commences.

The **Software Engineer** who has accepted or been assigned the issue selects it by assigning it to themselves in Jira and moving it to <span class="boxed_blue">ANALYSIS</span> if final refinement is required or it is an issue type such as a Spike.  Once Analysis is complete, the issue is moved to <span class="boxed_blue">ANALYSIS DONE</span>, if the ticket cannot be progresses immediately into the next doing status.  When the Software Engineer is ready to start Coding the issue is moved into
<span class="boxed_blue">CODE</span>. At this point, the Software Engineer now implements the issue as laid out in the plan.

Once the developer considers the coding phase completed, they move the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">CODE DONE</span> and create a pull request for the **Code Reviewer(s)** to inspect and move the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">CODE REVIEW</span>. If the pull request is rejected, the **Code Reviewer** moves the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">CODE REVIEW DONE</span> and the developer performs any necessary rework. The previous steps are repeated until the PR is accepted.
Upon accepting and merging the pull request, the **Code Reviewer** moves the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">CODE REVIEW DONE</span>.

A **Software Engineer** can now pick up the issue, assign it to themselves, and moves the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">TEST</span>. Existing regression and performance tests are modified and extended to cover the issue. If previous regression scenarios **fail or performance has been degraded**, team member who performed testing (or SE who developed itself) can request rework by the developer moving the issue back to <span class="boxed_blue">TEST</span> and informing the Software engineer what the problems are.
**This process repeats until all tests pass and all performance criteria have been met**, Software Engineer moves the issue to <span class="boxed_blue">TEST DONE</span> adding **test results** information to the issue.

Issues in the <span class="boxed_blue">TEST DONE</span> state that meet **Definition of Done** are moved to the <span class="boxed_green">READY TO DEPLOY</span> status and are shown to the **Product Owner** and other stakeholders at or prior at the **Sprint Review** meeting at the conclusion of each sprint. Feedback is gathered from attendees from which the backlog may be re-prioritised or new issues are created as appropriate for refinement and prioritisation. The **Product Owner** may decide that the issue should not be deployed at this stage and will have the appropriate discussions around next steps

Once the issue enters the <span class="boxed_green">READY TO DEPLOY</span> state and the Product Owner has decided to release, it is ready to be picked up for the next Release Qualification train. See [Deployment Process](https://engineering-handbook.takeofftech.org/docs/domains/production/rt-track-and-scope/) for more details on the train schedule. **Team-Chameleon**(aka System QA) runs both automated suites as well as any manual scenarios that have not yet been automated. In the event that an issue is discovered, the System QA team may log additional **Bug** task(s) in order for the developer to address
the findings, which may be considered blocking if high enough severity. For teams and services that have adopted [non release-train processes](https://takeofftech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2523202157/Non+Release-Train+Deployment+Production+Process),
the team will begin preparing to release on their own, taking on much the same role as the Systems QA team during release train validation.

(Under Development) Once System QA has deployed the Release Qualification Train to the first retailer’s Production site, they move the issue to **Deploying**. Once Systems QA has deployed the Release Qualification Train to all retailer’s Production sites, they move the issue to **Deployed**. **NOTE:** Teams using [non release-train processes](https://takeofftech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2523202157/Non+Release-Train+Deployment+Production+Process) may do some or all of this on their own as they are deploying.

## Schedule
All teams are aligned on a 2-week cycle. Below is our cadence.

## Process: Add mid-release train changes to builds

This section explains the steps that must be completed when a new fix or change needs to be incorporated into builds while release qualification testing and deployment is already underway for a Release Train.   

When Release Train testing work begins, the latest builds from Master, or recommended builds from Scrum teams are identified as “ready for deployment”. Bugs that must be included in the outgoing deployments for one or more clients are occasionally found and fixed during testing by Team Сhamaeleon, or by Scrum teams during regression testing.

Usually, by the time a bug is found and fixed, Team Chamaeleon engineers have made significant progress, or entirely completed testing for the applicable client(s). Generally, however, the fix can be incorporated into the build as long as the release hasn't already been deployed to the client(s).  

**Process steps**

To keep the retesting process to a minimum and to avoid new bugs with fixes, perform the following steps to get a fix or change added to a build version that is currently being tested: 

  **Process steps for Scrum teams:**
   1. Add your change/fix to Master for the given repo 
   2. Cherry-pick your change as a **hotfix** to the Active RTs **Release**. Understanding what version is currently part of a given active RT can be done by going to release-train-management and then navigating to ReleaseTrains/RT<ww>-<yy>/services.yaml. Add your fix to that build/release-branch as a "hotfix" (for example, OMS **21-09-22.359** is incremented as **21-09-22.359-hotfix.1).**
   3. Update all related Jira tickets (except RT ticket). They must have the Clients Impacted field populated, and if release notes are required, please make sure to mark **Release Notes Required = Yes**, and add a **Release Note Description**.
   4. A hotfix should be tested by Scrum team.
   5. Write a message about changes in hot-fix in Slack in **#production-domain** and tag **@team-chamaeleon.** Should the Chamaeleon team re-test any part of RQ and for which Clients - write in the thread in Slack where there is a discussion about this change.

  **Process steps for Chamaeleon team:**
   1. Read the thread in Slack where there is a discussion about this change.
   2. Create a PR to update the appropriate services.yaml file and merge that to Master of the release-train-management repo.
